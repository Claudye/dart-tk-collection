 
- Unique method: This method can be used to filter out unique items in the collection, removing duplicates.  
- reduce method: This method can be used to reduce the collection to a single value by applying a cumulative function to each element.


- The min and max must accept a callback

    firstIndexWhere: This method could return the index of the first element in the collection that satisfies a given condition. This would be similar to the firstWhere method, but instead of returning the element itself, it would return its index in the collection.

    lastIndexWhere: Similar to firstIndexWhere, this method would return the index of the last element in the collection that satisfies a given condition.

    distinct: As mentioned above, a method for removing duplicate elements from the collection.

    copy: A method for creating a deep copy of the collection, ensuring that the elements of the original collection are not modified when the copy is modified.

    flatten: A method for flattening a collection of collections into a single collection. This would be useful if you have a collection of nested lists and want to flatten them into a single list.

    slice: A method for extracting a slice from the collection, similar to take and skip, but taking both a start and end index.

    replaceAll: A method for replacing all occurrences of a given element with another element in the collection.

    countWhere: A method for counting the number of elements in the collection that satisfy a given condition.

    partition: A method for dividing the collection into two distinct collections according to a given condition.
